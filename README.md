# Branch `[master]`

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros> was transferred here on 2019-06-25. The
`master` branch is in the process of being upgraded to be able to build the
current ROS 1 and ROS 2 distros that support Ubuntu **bionic** (Crystal Clemmys,
Dashing Diademata, and Melodic Morenia) from recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/) and might not be
usable for a little while. Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what is being done. Draft versions of these changes are in this
branch.

The original implementation has been retained in the
[`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.

As of 2020-02-09, this branch can be used to build the December 2019 releases of
ROS 2  **dashing**, and **eloquent**, and the portion of ROS 1 **melodic**
required for the TurtleBot 3, using the not yet released OpenEmbedded
**dunfell** on Ubuntu **bionic**. Multiple sublayers must be used. See
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions)
for instructions.

DESCRIPTION = "Playstation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 joystick driver.     Driver for the Sony PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3     joysticks. In its current state, this driver is not compatible     with the use of other Bluetooth HID devices. The driver listens     for a connection on the HID ports, starts the joystick     streaming data, and passes the data to the Linux uinput device     so that it shows up as a normal joystick."

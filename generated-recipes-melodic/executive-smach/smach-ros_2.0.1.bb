DESCRIPTION = "The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to     integrate it tightly with ROS.  For example, SMACH-ROS can call     ROS services, listen to ROS topics, and integrate     with <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/actionlib">actionlib</a>     both as a client, and a provider of action servers.  SMACH is a     new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to     quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular     code."

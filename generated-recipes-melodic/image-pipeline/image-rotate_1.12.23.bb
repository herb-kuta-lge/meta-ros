DESCRIPTION = "<p>       Contains a node that rotates an image stream in a way that minimizes       the angle between a vector in some arbitrary frame and a vector in the       camera frame. The frame of the outgoing image is published by the node.     </p>     <p>       This node is intended to allow camera images to be visualized in an       orientation that is more intuitive than the hardware-constrained       orientation of the physical camera. This is particularly helpful, for       example, to show images from the PR2's forearm cameras with a       consistent up direction, despite the fact that the forearms need to       rotate in arbitrary ways during manipulation.     </p>     <p>       It is not recommended to use the output from this node for further       computation, as it interpolates the source image, introduces black       borders, and does not output a camera_info.     </p>"
